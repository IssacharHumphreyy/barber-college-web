The school is conveniently located near transportation and in a locality that affords ample opportunity for practical work. We are housed on the main floor of a one-story brick building, which is adequately lighted, heated and air-conditioned.

We have twenty-three barber chairs and all the necessary facilities and equipment for handling the maximum number of students allowed.

Attendance

Students are required to maintain prompt and regular attendance. Records are kept showing absence, tardiness, hours completed, practical/theory. Students will be allowed 3 absences per month, unless cleared through administration. Afterwards, students will be dropped. Any reinstatement will be based on admininistrative review, a reinstatement fee, a current tuition balance for hours completed, and a months tuition in advance. All course hours and assignments must be completed before a graduation certificate will be issued.

Students missing 3 examinations or failing in as many, will require immediate effort to make up work, for which students will be given 2 weeks. if this is not accomplished, students training will be suspended for 1 month, or face expulsion if failure continues. Records will be kept to show progress made in theory and practical study.

Student Conduct

McCoy Barber college has always maintained a very unique student body. We strive to maintain a high level of professionalism that should be carried throughout the career. We will not tolerate less than respectful, behavior as a student or a human being . At those times when a student forgets his/her best, we will reiterate conduct codes expected from a student. There is no excuse for not knowing the rules and regulations of the school.</p>
